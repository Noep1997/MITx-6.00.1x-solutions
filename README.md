# MITx-6.00.1x-solutions

I worked as a remote Course Assistant for the Harvard Kennedy School Python Pilot program, which used this edX MITx course as the material to teach Harvard Kennedy School students the basics of programming. This is the repository of my solutions to the problem sets.

Please work on the problems on your own before looking up the solutions. These are meant as a way for people to improve on their programming and algorithmic thinking skills.

The format of the files is as follows: phil_psetnumber_problemnumber.py
